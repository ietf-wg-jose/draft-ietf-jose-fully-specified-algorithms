	This specification refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers
	that fully specify the cryptographic operations to be performed,
	including any curve, key derivation function (KDF), hash functions, etc.,
	as being "fully specified".
	Whereas, it refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers
	that require additional information beyond the algorithm identifier
	to determine the cryptographic operations to be performed
	as being "polymorphic".
	This specification creates fully-specified algorithm identifiers for registered
	JOSE and COSE polymorphic algorithm identifiers,
	enabling applications to use only fully-specified algorithm identifiers.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	The IANA algorithm registries for JOSE <xref target="IANA.JOSE.Algorithms"/> and
	COSE <xref target="IANA.COSE.Algorithms"/> contain two kinds of algorithm identifiers:
      </t>
      <t>
	<list style="hanging">

          <t hangText="Fully Specified">
	    <vspace/>
	    Those that fully determine the cryptographic operations to be performed,
	    including any curve, key derivation function (KDF), hash functions, etc.
	    Examples are <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">ES256K</spanx> in both JOSE and COSE
	    and <spanx style="verb">ES256</spanx> in JOSE.
	  </t>

          <t hangText="Polymorphic">
	    <vspace/>
	    Those requiring information beyond the algorithm identifier
	    to determine the cryptographic operations to be performed.
	    Such additional information could include the actual key value and a curve that it uses.
	    Examples are <spanx style="verb">EdDSA</spanx> in both JOSE and COSE
	    and <spanx style="verb">ES256</spanx> in COSE.
	  </t>

	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	This matters because many protocols negotiate supported operations using only algorithm identifiers.
	For instance, OAuth Authorization Server Metadata <xref target="RFC8414"/>
	uses negotiation parameters like these (from an example in the specification):
	<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported":
    ["RS256", "ES256"]
]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>
      <t>
	OpenID Connect Discovery <xref target="OpenID.Discovery"/> likewise negotiates supported algorithms
	using <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">enc</spanx> values.
	W3C Web Authentication <xref target="WebAuthn"/> and
	FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) <xref target="FIDO2"/>
	negotiate using COSE <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> numbers.
      </t>
      <t>
	This does not work for polymorphic algorithms.
	For instance, with <spanx style="verb">EdDSA</spanx>, you do not know which of the curves
	<spanx style="verb">Ed25519</spanx> and/or <spanx style="verb">Ed448</spanx> are supported!
	This causes real problems in practice.
      </t>
      <t>
	WebAuthn contains this de-facto algorithm definition to work around this problem:
	<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  -8 (EdDSA), where crv is 6 (Ed25519)
]]></artwork></figure>
      </t>
      <t>
	This redefines the COSE <spanx style="verb">EdDSA</spanx> algorithm identifier
	for the purposes of WebAuthn to restrict it to using
	the <spanx style="verb">Ed25519</spanx> curve - making it non-polymorphic
	so that algorithm negotiation can succeed, but also effectively
	eliminating the possibility of using <spanx style="verb">Ed448</spanx>.
	Other similar workarounds for polymorphic algorithm identifiers are used in practice.
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification creates fully-specified algorithm identifiers for registered
	polymorphic JOSE and COSE algorithms and their parameters,
	enabling applications to use only fully-specified algorithm identifiers.
	It furthermore deprecates the practice of registering polymorphic algorithm identifiers.

    <section anchor="fully-specified-encryption-algs" title="Fully-specified Encryption Algorithm Identifiers">
      <t>
  This section describes the construction of fully-specified encryption algorithm identifiers in the context of existing the JOSE and COSE encryption schemes
  JSON Web Encryption (JWE) as described in <xref target="RFC7516"/> and
  COSE Encrypt as described in <xref target="RFC9052"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
JOSE and COSE support several modes of encryption, although the terminology may differ between JOSE and COSE,
these modes are meant to support:
      </t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
Direct Encryption - A symmetric cryptographic operation.
        </t>
        <t>
Key Establishment with Direct Encryption - An asymmetric cryptographic operation to derive a shared secret, key derivation and then a symmetric cryptographic operation.
        </t>
        <t>
Two-Layer Encryption - A content encryption key is protected (many possible ways), content encryption and decryption is performed using the protected content encryption key.
        </t>
      </list>
      <t>
Mode complexity creates the following risks:
      </t>

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
The combination of chosen algorithms might not be implemented by the receiver.
        </t>
        <t>
The combination of chosen algorithms might not be aligned in terms of strength.
        </t>
        <t>
Underspecified or implicit parameters could lead to exploitable faults in implementations, for example, cross curve ECDH between P-256 and P-384 or X25519.
        </t>
        <t>
Alternative algorithms at a component layer, such as symmetric key encryption, might provide different security properties, for example, "A128GCM" vs. "A128CBC-HS256".
        </t>
      </list>

      <t>
While this specification provides a definition of what fully-specified encryption algorithm identifiers are for both JOSE and COSE, including examples,
it does not deprecate any polymorphic algorithms,
since complete replacements for them are not provided.
It does register a small set of new fully-specified encryption algorithms,
so that polymorphic encryption algorithms need not be used.
</t>

      <t>
The following sections describe what fully specified means for each mode.
They also register at least one fully-specified algorithm for each mode,
when one was not already available.
      </t>

      <section anchor="fully-specified-symmetric-encryption-algs" title="Direct Encryption">
<t>
Symmetric encryption algorithms generally satisfy the following interface:
</t>
<sourcecode>
secret_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, secret_key)
plaintext  = decrypt(ciphertext, secret_key)
</sourcecode>
<t>
Depending on the algorithm, additional parameters such as additional authenticated data (AAD) or initialization vector (IV) might be required.
</t>
<t>
In the special case where the plaintext is a content encryption key, to be used with a subsequent symmetric encryption algorithm,
such a symmetric encryption algorithm is referred to as a key wrapping algorithm and the secret_key is referred to as a key wrapping key.
</t>
<t>
An example of a fully-specified symmetric encryption algorithm is "A128GCM" (AES GCM using 128-bit key).
</t>
<t>
An example of a fully-specified key wrapping algorithm is "A128KW" (AES Key Wrap using 128-bit key).
</t>
<t>
A symmetric encryption algorithm is fully specified when it satisfies the interface above, and depends only on the parameters to the encrypt and decrypt operations.
</t>
<t>
Direct Encryption and Key Wrapping algorithms encode the primary symmetric key parameter (key length) in the algorithm identifier.
Key Wrapping algorithms impose additional implicit constraints on AAD and IV.
</t>

<t>
In JOSE and COSE, all currently registered Direct Encryption and Key Wrapping algorithms are fully specified.
</t>

<t>
Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Direct Encryption:
</t>
<sourcecode>
{
  "alg": "dir",
  "enc": "A128GCM",
  ...
}
</sourcecode>

      <section anchor="fully-specified-direct-encryption-algs" title="Key Establishment with Direct Encryption">
<t>
Key establishment with direct encryption algorithms generally satisfy the following interface:
</t>
<sourcecode>
private_key, public_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, public_key)
plaintext  = decrypt(ciphertext, private_key)
</sourcecode>

<t>
Depending on the symmetric algorithm, additional parameters such as additional authenticated data (AAD) or initialization vector (IV) might be required.
</t>

<t>
Although JOSE and COSE encode this type of encryption differently, both rely on a symmetric key derived from an asymmetric key.
An algorithm called a key derivation function (KDF) is applied between key establishment and symmetric encryption.
</t>

<t>
Key establishment algorithms often rely on an asymmetric cryptographic operation whereby a public and a private key are used to produce a shared secret, which can be combined with a KDF to produce a symmetric key.
The process of producing a shared secret is key type specific, and is different for elliptic curves, RSA, and lattice based algorithms.
</t>

<t>
Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is used to produce a shared secret with elliptic curve based keys as follows:
</t>
<sourcecode>
private_key1, public_key1 = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
private_key2, public_key2 = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
shared_secret = derive_shared_secret(public_key1, private_key2)
shared_secret = derive_shared_secret(public_key2, private_key1)
</sourcecode>

<t>
An algorithm called a Key Encapsulation Mechanism, can be used to provide a common interface for deriving shared secrets, regardless of key type.
</t>

<t>
Key encapsulation algorithms generally satisfy the following interface:
</t>
<sourcecode>
private_key, public_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
ciphertext, shared_secret = encap(public_key)
shared_secret = decap(ciphertext, private_key)
</sourcecode>

<t>
When using Key Establishment with Direct Encryption, the ciphertext is not only the output of symmetric encryption, but also includes all parameters necessary for the recipient to decrypt the ciphertext.
Encrypted content encryption keys are not produced by fully-specified Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithms.
</t>

<t>
In JOSE, the KDF algorithm is "ConcatKDF" and is an implicit parameter of the key establishment algorithm.
In JOSE and COSE, key establishment algorithms have historically been generic to a key type including all its mandatory parameters.
For example, "ECDH-ES" establishes a shared secret, and then through the use of a KDF, a content encryption key, for keys based on elliptic curves.
However, the mandatory parameters of the public_key and private_key need be the same in the context of the key type.
</t>

<t>
For example, when using ECDH-ES with secp256r1 (P-256) to establish a shared secret,
the ECDH algorithm is a function of an ephemeral and a static key,
which need to be of the same key type, and having the same parameters, in this case, the curve parameter.
</t>

<t>
To successfully encrypt to a recipient, a sender needs to possess the recipient's key (which contains the curve parameter) and know the recipients supported algorithms.
</t>

<t>
In JOSE and COSE, key representations can support communicating the algorithm which a recipient supports for a given key.
It is considered a best practice to only support 1 algorithm during the lifetime of a key.
</t>

<t>
Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Key Establishment with Direct Encryption:
</t>

<sourcecode>
{
  "alg":"ECDH-ES",
  "enc":"A128GCM",
  ...
}
</sourcecode>

<!--
<t>
TODO: COSE EDN example.
</t>
-->

<t>
Despite containing both the key establishment algorithm (with an implicit KDF) and the symmetric encryption algorithm, the example above is not fully specified.
</t>

<t>
To make a Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithm fully specified, all essential parameters need to be encoded in the algorithm identifier.
In the context of the example above, the missing explicit parameters are curve name and KDF name.
If the KDF requires additional parameters, they need to be present.
</t>

<t>
To convey a fully-specified Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithm in JOSE, the "alg" value MUST be "dir",
and the "enc" value MUST be fully specified, specifying all essential parameters for both key establishment and symmetric encryption.
For example: "ECDH-ES-P256-CONCAT-KDF-A128GCM", "ECDH-ES-P384-CONCAT-KDF-A256GCM" or "ECDH-ES-X25519-CONCAT-KDF-A256GCM"
</t>

<t>
To convey a fully-specified Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithm in COSE, the "alg" value MUST specify all essential parameters for both key establishment and symmetric encryption.
For example: "ECDH-ES-P256-HKDF-SHA-256-A128GCM", "ECDH-ES-P384-HKDF-SHA-512-A256GCM" or "ECDH-ES-X25519-HKDF-SHA-512-A256GCM"
</t>

<t>
Fully-specified Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithms enable the sender and receiver to agree on all algorithms needed to encrypt and decrypt a message using a single algorithm identifier.
</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="fully-specified-key-wrapping-encryption-algs" title="Two-Layer Encryption">

<t>
This section describes Two-Layer Encryption in both JOSE and COSE.
Each defines multiple ways that a content encryption key can be produced and protected, then later used to decrypt or encrypt content.
</t>

<t>
This specification uses the term "Two-Layer Encryption" to refer to what JOSE describes as "Key Encryption" and "Key Agreement with Key Wrapping", and what COSE describes as "Key Transport" and "Key Agreement with Key Wrap".
</t>

<t>
A distinguishing characteristic of Two-Layer Encryption schemes is that multiple recipients can perform decryptions, using a wide range of algorithms, and that encrypted content encryption keys are always present.
</t>

<t>
In RSA-OAEP the encrypted content encryption key is generated through an asymmetric cryptographic operation.
</t>

<t>
When Key Wrapping without any key establishment is used, the content encryption key is encrypted using a symmetric cryptographic operation (key wrap).
How the content encryption key was generated is out of scope when considering this scheme.
</t>

<t>
As noted in the Direct Encryption section, Key wrapping algorithms generally satisfy the following interface:
</t>
<sourcecode>
key_encryption_key = \
key_generation(algorithm_identifier)

encrypted_content_encryption_key = \
encrypt(content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)

content_encryption_key  = \
decrypt(encrypted_content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)
</sourcecode>

<t>
When Key Establishment with Key Wrapping is used, the content encryption key is protected with Key Wrapping, where the Key Encryption Key is derived from an asymmetric cryptographic operation and a key derivation function.
</t>

<t>
Key Establishment with Key Wrapping algorithms generally satisfy the following interface:
</t>
<sourcecode>
private_key, public_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
# ignoring ephemeral static vs. static static, etc.

key_encryption_key = \
key_establishment(public_key, private_key)

encrypted_content_encryption_key = \
encrypt(content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)

content_encryption_key = \
decrypt(encrypted_content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)
</sourcecode>

<t>
The interface above is consistent with the Section on Key Establishment with Direct Encryption,
specifically the description of how the process of deriving a shared secret and content encryption key is specific to the asymmetric key type used.
The difference is that instead of using the derived content encryption key directly, Two-Layer encryption always derives a key encryption key, and wraps the content encryption key.
</t>

<t>
Regardless of how a Two-Layer Encryption scheme protects a content encryption key, content encryption algorithms generally satisfy the following interface:
</t>
<sourcecode>
content_encryption_key = \
unwrap or establish and unwrap or key transport...

ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, content_encryption_key)
plaintext  = decrypt(ciphertext, content_encryption_key)
</sourcecode>

<t>
Depending on the content encryption algorithm, additional parameters such as additional authenticated data (AAD) or initialization vector (IV) might be required.
</t>

<t>
Although JOSE and COSE encode Two-Layer Encryptions differently, both rely on an encrypted content encryption key.
The content encryption key is encrypted either using Key Wrapping directly, or through Key Establishment and then Key Wrapping or Key Transport or Key Encryption.
When Key Establishment is used, a KDF is usually applied during the production of the key encryption key,
to ensure that the content encryption algorithm that will be used with the encrypted content encryption key is known and agreed to by both sender and recipient.
</t>

<t>
When using Two-Layer Encryption, the ciphertext is not only the output of symmetric encryption, but also includes all parameters necessary for the recipient to decrypt the ciphertext,
including parameters for use with the key establishment algorithm, such as ephemeral or encapsulated keys, any required key derivation functions and their parameters and the key wrapping algorithm.
Encrypted content encryption keys are always present when Two-Layer Encryption algorithms are used.
Two-Layer Encryption is often used for encrypting the same plaintext to multiple recipients, in contrast with other modes which can only be used to encrypt to a single recipient.
</t>

<t>
Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Key Encryption using RSA-OAEP with AES-GCM:
</t>

<sourcecode>
{
  "alg": "RSA-OAEP",
  "enc": "A256GCM",
  ...
}
</sourcecode>

<t>
Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Key Encryption using ECDH-ES and AES-KeyWrap with AES-GCM:
</t>

<sourcecode>
{
  "alg": "ECDH-ES+A128KW",
  "enc": "A128GCM",
  ...
}
</sourcecode>

<t>
Despite containing both the key establishment algorithm, with either an implicit KDF, or a Key Transport algorithm and a symmetric encryption algorithm, the examples above are not fully specified.
</t>

<t>
To make a Two-Layer Encryption algorithm fully specified, all security relevant details need to be encoded in the algorithm identifier.
In the context of the examples above, the missing explicit parameters are curve name, kdf and required parameters, and content encryption algorithm to use with the decrypted content encryption key.
</t>

<t>
To convey a fully-specified Two-Layer Encryption in JOSE, the "alg" MUST specify all essential parameters for key establishment, key wrapping, and symmetric encryption.
For example: "ECDH-ES-P256-CONCAT-KDF-A128KW-A128GCM", "ECDH-ES-P384-CONCAT-KDF-A256KW-A256GCM", "RSA-OAEP-256-4096-A128GCM" or "ECDH-ES-X25519-CONCAT-KDF-A256KW-A256GCM"
</t>

<t>
To convey a fully-specified Two-Layer Encryption algorithm in COSE, the "alg" value MUST specify all essential parameters for key establishment, key wrapping, and symmetric encryption.
For example: "ECDH-ES-P256-HKDF-SHA-256-A128KW-A128GCM", "ECDH-ES-P384-HKDF-SHA-512-A256KW-A256GCM" or "ECDH-ES-X25519-HKDF-SHA-512-A256KW-A256GCM"
</t>

<t>
The symmetric encryption algorithm that will be used with the content encryption key after it is decrypted is required to prevent cross mode attacks, such as those described in RFC9459.
</t>

<t>
Fully-specified Two-Layer Encryption algorithms enable the sender and receiver to agree on all mandatory security parameters using a single algorithm identifier.
They also enable a protocol to specify an allow list of algorithm combinations that does not include polymorphic combinations,
such as cross curve key establishment,
cross mode symmetric encryption,
or mismatched KDF size to symmetric key scenarios.

    <section anchor="Keys" title="Key Representations">
      <t>
	The key representations for the new fully-specified algorithms
	defined by this specification are the same as those for the
	polymorphic algorithms that they replace,
	other than the <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> value, if included.
	For instance, the representation for a key used with the
	<spanx style="verb">Ed25519</spanx> algorithm is the same as that specified
	in <xref target="RFC8037"/>, except that the <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx>
	value would be <spanx style="verb">Ed25519</spanx> rather than
	<spanx style="verb">EdDSA</spanx>, if included.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="MultiAlgs" title="Fully-Specified Computations Using Multiple Algorithms">
      <t>
	Both JOSE and COSE have operations that take multiple algorithms as parameters.
	Encrypted objects in JOSE <xref target="RFC7516"/> use two algorithm identifiers:
	the first in the <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> (Algorithm) Header Parameter,
	which specifies how to determine the content encryption key, and
	the second in the <spanx style="verb">enc</spanx> (Encryption Algorithm)
	Header Parameter, which specifies the content encryption algorithm.
	Likewise, encrypted COSE objects can use multiple algorithms
	for corresponding purposes.
      </t>
      <t>
	Each of these multiple algorithms must be independently fully specified.
	The operations performed by each of them MUST NOT vary
	when used alongside other algorithms.
	So for instance, for JOSE, <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> values
	and <spanx style="verb">enc</spanx> values MUST each be fully specified,
	and their behaviors MUST NOT depend upon one another.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="NotUpdated" title="Notes on Algorithms Not Updated">
      <t>
	The working group has discussed some existing algorithms that are not updated
	by this specification.
	This section discusses why they have not been updated.
      </t>

      <section anchor="RSA" title="Algorithms for Signing with RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5">
	<t>
	  The working group has discussed whether the
	  <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx>,
	  <spanx style="verb">RS384</spanx>, and
	  <spanx style="verb">RS512</spanx> algorithms
	  should be considered fully-specified or not,
	  because they can operate on keys of different sizes.
	  For instance, they can use both 2048- and 4096-bit keys.
	  The same is true of the <spanx style="verb">PS*</spanx> algorithms.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This is not a problem in practice, because RSA libraries accommodate
	  keys of different sizes without having to use different code.
	  Therefore, for example, there are not known cases in the wild where it would be useful
	  to have different algorithm identifiers for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-256 and 2048-bit keys
	  and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-256 and 4096-bit keys or 8192-bit keys.
	  Therefore, the RSA signature algorithms are not replaced by this specification.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ECDH-ES" title="ECDH-ES and its Ephemeral Keys">
	<t>
	  The working group has discussed whether the
	  <spanx style="verb">ECDH-ES</spanx> key agreement algorithm
	  should be considered fully-specified or not,
	  because it can use ephemeral keys of different key types and algorithms.
	  Indeed, an implementation might work when <spanx style="verb">ECDH-ES</spanx>
	  is used with ephemeral keys using the <spanx style="verb">P-256</spanx> curve,
	  and not work when used with ephemeral keys using the
	  <spanx style="verb">Ed25519</spanx> curve.
	</t>
	<t>
	  One way that protocols can handle this situation is to use a discovery mechanism
	  to declare what ephemeral key types are supported.
	  The alternative would be to introduce new fully-specified algorithm identifiers
	  for choices such as "ECDH-ES with the P-256 Curve", etc.
	  Feedback from deployers would be useful in determining
	  what actions this specification should take in this case.
	</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	Using fully-specified algorithm identifiers reduces the attack surface
	relative to using polymorphic algorithm identifiers,
	since it reduces the opportunity for attackers to choose insecure or unexpected combinations of algorithms.
      </t>
      <t>
	The security considerations for ECDSA in <xref target="RFC7518"/>,
	for EdDSA in <xref target="RFC8037"/>, and
	for ECDSA and EdDSA in <xref target="RFC9053"/> apply.

    <section title="Inventory of Polymorphic ECDH Algorithms" anchor="PolymorphicECDH">
      <t>
	The working group assembled the following inventory of registered polymorphic
	Elliptic Curve Diffie Helman (ECDH) JOSE and COSE algorithms
	with the goal of understanding what
	registering fully-specified ECDH algorithms to replace them would entail.
	While there was not an appetite in the working group
	to register the full set of replacement algorithms at this time,
	this inventory documents how to do so,
	should others wish to register some or all of the replacements in the future.
      </t>
      <t>
	Nonetheless, because working group members did document that
	not having fully-specified algorithms is a problem for some use cases,
	The engineering compromise employed in this specification is
	to register a single fully-specified ECDH algorithm of each kind
	so that it becomes possible to rely only on fully-specified ECDH algorithms
	for JOSE and COSE.
	<!-- This is done in <xref target="fully-specified-ECDH"/>. -->
