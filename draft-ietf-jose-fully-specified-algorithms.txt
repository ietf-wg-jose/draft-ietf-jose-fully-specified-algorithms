              Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE
           draft-ietf-jose-fully-specified-algorithms-latest

Abstract

   This specification refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers that
   fully specify the cryptographic operations to be performed, including
   any curve, key derivation function (KDF), and hash functions, as
   being "fully specified".  It refers to cryptographic algorithm
   identifiers that require additional information beyond the algorithm
   identifier to determine the cryptographic operations to be performed
   as being "polymorphic".  This specification creates fully-specified
   algorithm identifiers for registered JSON Object Signing and
   Encryption (JOSE) and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
   polymorphic algorithm identifiers, enabling applications to use only
   fully-specified algorithm identifiers.  It deprecates those
   polymorphic algorithm identifiers.

   This specification updates RFC 7518, RFC 8037, and RFC 9053.  It
   deprecates polymorphic algorithms defined by RFC 8037 and RFC 9053
   and provides fully-specified replacements for them.  It adds to the
   instructions to designated experts in RFC 7518 and RFC 9053.

1.  Introduction

   The IANA algorithm registries for JSON Object Signing and Encryption
   (JOSE) algorithms [IANA.JOSE] and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption
   (COSE) algorithms [IANA.COSE] contain two kinds of algorithm
   identifiers:

   Fully Specified
      Those that fully determine the cryptographic operations to be
      performed, including any curve, key derivation function (KDF), and
      hash functions.  Examples are RS256 and ES256K in both JOSE
      [IANA.JOSE] and COSE [IANA.COSE] and ES256 in JOSE.

   Polymorphic
      Those requiring information beyond the algorithm identifier to
      determine the cryptographic operations to be performed.  Such
      additional information could include the actual key value and a
      curve that it uses.  Examples are EdDSA in both JOSE [IANA.JOSE]
      and COSE [IANA.COSE] and ES256 in COSE.

   This matters because many protocols negotiate supported operations
   using only algorithm identifiers.  For instance, OAuth Authorization
   Server Metadata [RFC8414] uses negotiation parameters like these
   (from an example in the specification):

     "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported":
       ["RS256", "ES256"]

   OpenID Connect Discovery [OpenID.Discovery] likewise negotiates
   supported algorithms using alg and enc values.  W3C Web
   Authentication [WebAuthn] and FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol
   (CTAP) [FIDO2] negotiate using COSE alg numbers.

   This does not work for polymorphic algorithms.  For instance, with
   EdDSA, it is not known which of the curves Ed25519 and/or Ed448 are
   supported.  This causes real problems in practice.

   WebAuthn contains this de-facto algorithm definition to work around
   this problem:

     -8 (EdDSA), where crv is 6 (Ed25519)

   This redefines the COSE EdDSA algorithm identifier for the purposes
   of WebAuthn to restrict it to using the Ed25519 curve - making it
   non-polymorphic so that algorithm negotiation can succeed, but also
   effectively eliminating the possibility of using Ed448.  Other
   similar workarounds for polymorphic algorithm identifiers are used in
   practice.

   Note that using fully-specified algorithms is sometimes referred to
   as the "cipher suite" approach; using polymorphic algorithms is
   sometimes referred to as the "à la carte" approach.

   This specification creates fully-specified algorithm identifiers for
   registered polymorphic JOSE and COSE algorithms and their parameters,
   enabling applications to use only fully-specified algorithm
   identifiers.  Furthermore, it deprecates the practice of registering
   polymorphic algorithm identifiers.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Fully-Specified Digital Signature Algorithm Identifiers

   This section creates fully-specified digital signature algorithm
   identifiers for a set of registered polymorphic JOSE and COSE
   algorithms and their parameters.

2.1.  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

   [RFC9053] defines a way to use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) with COSE.  The COSE algorithm registrations for
   ECDSA are polymorphic, since they do not specify the curve used.  For
   instance, ES256 is defined as "ECDSA w/ SHA-256" in Section 2.1 of
   [RFC9053].  (The corresponding JOSE registrations in [RFC7518] are
   full-specified.)

   The following fully-specified COSE ECDSA algorithms are defined by
   this specification:

      +========+==================+===================+=============+
      | Name   | COSE Value       | Description       | COSE        |

      |        | assignment -267) | BrainpoolP384r1   |             |
      |        |                  | curve and SHA-384 |             |
      +--------+------------------+-------------------+-------------+
      | ESB512 | TBD (requested   | ECDSA using       | No          |

      |        |                  | curve and SHA-512 |             |
      +--------+------------------+-------------------+-------------+

2.2.  Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)

   [RFC8037] defines a way to use the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (EdDSA) with JOSE and [RFC9053] defines a way to use it
   with COSE.  Both register polymorphic EdDSA algorithm identifiers.

   The following fully-specified JOSE and COSE EdDSA algorithms are
   defined by this specification:

    +=======+============+=============+================+=============+
    |Name   | COSE Value | Description | JOSE           | COSE        |

3.  Fully-Specified Encryption

   This section describes the construction of fully-specified encryption
   algorithm identifiers in the context of the JOSE and COSE encryption
   schemes JSON Web Encryption (JWE), as described in [RFC7516] and
   [RFC7518], and COSE Encrypt, as described in [RFC9052] and [RFC9053].

   Using fully-specified encryption algorithms enables the sender and
   receiver to agree on all mandatory security parameters.  They also
   enable protocols to specify an allow list of algorithm combinations
   that does not include polymorphic combinations, preventing problems
   such as cross-curve key establishment, cross-protocol symmetric
   encryption, or mismatched KDF size to symmetric key scenarios.

   Both JOSE and COSE have operations that take multiple algorithms as
   parameters.  Encrypted objects in JOSE [RFC7516] use two algorithm
   identifiers: the first in the "alg" (Algorithm) Header Parameter,
   which specifies how to determine the content encryption key, and the
   second in the "enc" (Encryption Algorithm) Header Parameter, which
   specifies the content encryption algorithm.  Likewise, encrypted COSE
   objects can use multiple algorithms for corresponding purposes.  This
   section describes how to fully specify encryption algorithms for JOSE
   and COSE.

   To perform fully-specified encryption in JOSE, the "alg" value MUST
   specify all parameters for key establishment or derive some of them
   from the accompanying "enc" value and the "enc" value MUST specify
   all parameters for symmetric encryption.  For example, JWE encryption
   using an "alg" value of "A128KW" (AES Key Wrap using 128-bit key) and
   an "enc" value of "A128GCM" (AES GCM using 128-bit key) uses fully-
   specified algorithms.

   Note that in JOSE, there is the option to derive some cryptographic
   parameters used in the "alg" computation from the accompanying "enc"
   value.  An example of this is that the keydatalen KDF parameter value
   for "ECDH-ES" is determined from the "enc" value, as described in
   Section 4.6.2 of [RFC7518].  For the purposes of an "alg" value being
   fully-specified, deriving parameters from "enc" does not make the
   algorithm polymorphic, as the computation is still fully determined
   by the algorithm identifiers used.  This option is not present in
   COSE.

   To perform fully-specified encryption in COSE, the outer "alg" value
   MUST specify all parameters for key establishment and the inner "alg"
   value must specify all parameters for symmetric encryption.  For
   example, COSE encryption using an outer "alg" value of A128KW and an
   inner "alg" value of A128GCM uses fully-specified algorithms.  Note
   that when using COSE_Encrypt, as specified in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC9052], the outer "alg" is communicated in the headers of the
   COSE_Encrypt object and the inner "alg" is communicated in the
   headers of the COSE_recipient object.

   While this specification provides a definition of what fully-
   specified encryption algorithm identifiers are for both JOSE and
   COSE, it does not deprecate any polymorphic encryption algorithms,
   since replacements for them are not provided by this specification.
   This is discussed in Section 6.2.

3.1.  Fully-Specified Encryption Algorithms

   Many of the registered JOSE and COSE algorithms used for encryption
   are already fully-specified.  This section discusses them.

   All the symmetric encryption algorithms registered by [RFC7518] and
   [RFC9053] are fully-specified.  An example of a fully-specified
   symmetric encryption algorithm is "A128GCM" (AES GCM using 128-bit
   key).

   In both JOSE and COSE, all registered key wrapping algorithms are
   fully specified, as are the key wrapping with AES GCM algorithms.  An
   example of a fully-specified key wrapping algorithm is "A128KW" (AES
   Key Wrap using 128-bit key).

   The JOSE "dir" and COSE "direct" algorithms are fully specified.  The
   COSE direct+HKDF algorithms are fully specified.

   The JOSE Key Encryption with PBES2 algorithms are fully specified.

3.2.  Polymorphic Encryption Algorithms

   Some of the registered JOSE and COSE algorithms used for encryption
   are polymorphic.  This section discusses them.

   The ECDH key establishment algorithms in both JOSE and COSE are
   polymorphic because they do not specify the elliptic curve to be used
   for the key.  This is true of the ephemeral key for the Ephemeral-
   Static (ES) algorithms registered for JOSE and COSE and of the static
   key for the Static-Static (SS) algorithms registered by COSE.  See
   more discussion of ECDH algorithms in Section 6.2.

4.3.  Updated Review Instructions for Designated Experts

4.3.1.  JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms

   IANA is directed to preserve the current reference to RFC 7518, and
   to add a reference to this section of this specification.

   The review instructions for the designated experts for the IANA "JSON
   Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry [IANA.JOSE] in
   Section 7.1 of [RFC7518] have been updated to include an additional
   review criterion:

   *  Only fully-specified algorithm identifiers may be registered.
      Polymorphic algorithm identifiers must not be registered.

4.3.2.  COSE Algorithms

   IANA is directed to preserve the current references to RFC 9053 and
   RFC 9054, and to add a reference to this section of this
   specification.

   The review instructions for the designated experts for the IANA "COSE
   Algorithms" registry [IANA.COSE] in Section 10.4 of [RFC9053] have
   been updated to include an additional review criterion:

   *  Only fully-specified algorithm identifiers may be registered.
      Polymorphic algorithm identifiers must not be registered.

4.4.  Defining Deprecated and Prohibited

   The terms "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" as used by JOSE and COSE
   registrations are currently undefined.  Furthermore, while in
   [RFC7518] JOSE specifies that both "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" can
   be used, in [RFC8152] COSE specifies the use of "Deprecated" but not
   "Prohibited".  This section defines these terms for use by both JOSE
   and COSE IANA registrations in a consistent manner, eliminating this
   potentially confusing inconsistency.

   For purposes of use in the "JOSE Implementation Requirements" columns
   in the IANA JOSE registries [IANA.JOSE] and in the "Recommended"
   columns in the IANA COSE registries [IANA.COSE], these terms are
   defined as follows:

   Deprecated
      There is a preferred mechanism to achieve similar functionality to
      that referenced by the identifier; this replacement functionality
      SHOULD be utilized in new deployments in preference to the
      deprecated identifier, unless there exist documented operational
      or regulatory requirements that prevent migration away from the
      deprecated identifier.

   Prohibited
      The identifier and the functionality that it references MUST NOT
      be used.  (Identifiers may be designated as "Prohibited" due to
      security flaws, for instance.)

   For completeness, these definitions bring the set of defined terms
   for use in the "Recommended" columns in the IANA COSE registries
   [IANA.COSE] to "Yes" [RFC8152], "No" [RFC8152], "Filter Only"
   [RFC9054], "Prohibited", and "Deprecated".  This updates the
   definitions of the "Recommended" columns in these registries to be:

   Recommended:  Does the IETF have a consensus recommendation to use
      the algorithm?  The legal values are "Yes", "No", "Filter Only",
      "Prohibited", and "Deprecated".


   The set of defined terms for use in the "JOSE Implementation
   Requirements" columns in the IANA JOSE registries [IANA.JOSE] are
   unchanged.

   Note that the terms "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" have been used with
   a multiplicity of different meanings in various specifications,
   sometimes without actually being defined in those specifications.
   For instance, the term "Deprecated" is used in the title of
   [RFC8996], but the actual specification text uses the terminology
   "MUST NOT be used".

   The definitions above were chosen because they are consistent with
   all existing registrations in both JOSE and COSE; none will need to
   change.  Furthermore, they are consistent with their existing usage
   in JOSE.  The only net change is to enable a clear distinction
   between "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" in future COSE registrations.

5.  Key Representations

   The key representations for the new fully-specified algorithms
   defined by this specification are the same as those for the
   polymorphic algorithms that they replace, other than the alg value,
   if included.  For instance, the representation for a key used with
   the Ed25519 algorithm is the same as that specified in [RFC8037],
   except that the alg value would be Ed25519 rather than EdDSA, if
   included.

6.  Notes on Algorithms Not Updated

   Some existing polymorphic algorithms are not updated by this
   specification.  This section discusses why they have not been
   updated.

6.1.  RSA Signing Algorithms

   There are different points of view on whether the RS256, RS384, and
   RS512 algorithms should be considered fully-specified or not, because
   they can operate on keys of different sizes.  For instance, they can
   use both 2048- and 4096-bit keys.  The same is true of the PS*
   algorithms.

   This document does not describe or request registration of any fully
   specified RSA algorithms.  Some RSA signing implementations, such as
   FIPS-compliant Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) [FIPS.140-3] limit
   RSA key parameters to specific values with acceptable security
   characteristics.  This approach could be extended to define fully-
   specified RSA algorithms in the future.

   That said, should it be useful at some point to have RSA algorithm
   identifiers that are specific to particular key characteristics, a
   future specification could always register them.

6.2.  ECDH Key Agreement Algorithms

   This specification does not update the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) algorithms, but describes how to potentially do so in the
   future, if needed.  The registered JOSE and COSE ECDH algorithms are
   polymorphic because they do not specify the curve to be used for the
   ephemeral key.

   Fully-specified versions of these algorithms would specify all
   choices needed, including the KDF and the curve.  For instance, an
   algorithm performing ECDH-ES using the Concat KDF and the P-256
   curve, would be fully-specified and could be defined and registered.
   While this specification does not define and register such
   replacement algorithms, other specifications could do so in the
   future, if desired.

6.3.  HSS/LMS Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm

   The HSS-LMS algorithm registered by COSE is polymorphic.  It is
   polymorphic because the algorithm identifier does not specify the
   hash function to be used.  Like ECDH, this specification does not
   register replacement algorithms, but future specifications could do
   so.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for ECDSA in [RFC7518], for EdDSA in
   [RFC8037], and for ECDSA and EdDSA in [RFC9053] apply.

   The security considerations for preventing cross-protocol attacks
   described in [RFC9459] apply.

   An "attack signature" is a unique pattern or characteristic used to
   identify malicious activity, enabling systems to detect and respond
   to known threats.  The digital signature and key establishment
   algorithms used by software can contribute to an attack signature.
   By varying the identifier used for an algorithm, some software
   systems may attempt to evade rule-based detection and classification.
   Rule-based detection and classification systems may need to update
   their rules to account for fully-specified algorithms.  These systems
   should be aware that writing rules for polymorphic algorithms is more
   difficult, as each variant of the algorithm must be accounted for.
   For example, ES384 in COSE might be used with 3 different keys, each
   with a different curve.

   A cryptographic key MUST be used with only a single algorithm unless
   the use of the same key with different algorithms is proven secure.
   See [Reuse25519] for an example of such a proof.  As a result, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the algorithm parameter of JSON Web Keys and COSE
   Keys be present, unless there exists some other mechanism for
   ensuring the key is used as intended.

   In COSE, preventing cross-protocol attacks, such as those described
   in [RFC9459], can be accomplished in two ways:

   1.  Allow only authenticated content encryption (AEAD) algorithms.

   2.  Bind the potentially unauthenticated content encryption algorithm
       to be used into the key protection algorithm so that different
       content encryption algorithms result in different content
       encryption keys.

   Which choice to use in which circumstances is beyond the scope of
   this specification.
