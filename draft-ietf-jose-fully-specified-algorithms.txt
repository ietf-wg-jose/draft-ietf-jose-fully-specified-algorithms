              Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE
           draft-ietf-jose-fully-specified-algorithms-latest

Abstract

   This specification refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers that
   fully specify the cryptographic operations to be performed, including
   any curve, key derivation function (KDF), hash functions, etc., as
   being "fully specified".  Whereas, it refers to cryptographic
   algorithm identifiers that require additional information beyond the
   algorithm identifier to determine the cryptographic operations to be
   performed as being "polymorphic".  This specification creates fully-
   specified algorithm identifiers for registered JOSE and COSE
   polymorphic algorithm identifiers, enabling applications to use only
   fully-specified algorithm identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   The IANA algorithm registries for JOSE [IANA.JOSE] and COSE
   [IANA.COSE] contain two kinds of algorithm identifiers:

   Fully Specified
      Those that fully determine the cryptographic operations to be
      performed, including any curve, key derivation function (KDF),
      hash functions, etc.  Examples are RS256 and ES256K in both JOSE
      and COSE and ES256 in JOSE.

   Polymorphic
      Those requiring information beyond the algorithm identifier to
      determine the cryptographic operations to be performed.  Such
      additional information could include the actual key value and a
      curve that it uses.  Examples are EdDSA in both JOSE and COSE and
      ES256 in COSE.

   This matters because many protocols negotiate supported operations
   using only algorithm identifiers.  For instance, OAuth Authorization
   Server Metadata [RFC8414] uses negotiation parameters like these
   (from an example in the specification):

     "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported":
       ["RS256", "ES256"]

   OpenID Connect Discovery [OpenID.Discovery] likewise negotiates
   supported algorithms using alg and enc values.  W3C Web
   Authentication [WebAuthn] and FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol
   (CTAP) [FIDO2] negotiate using COSE alg numbers.

   This does not work for polymorphic algorithms.  For instance, with
   EdDSA, you do not know which of the curves Ed25519 and/or Ed448 are
   supported!  This causes real problems in practice.

   WebAuthn contains this de-facto algorithm definition to work around
   this problem:

     -8 (EdDSA), where crv is 6 (Ed25519)

   This redefines the COSE EdDSA algorithm identifier for the purposes
   of WebAuthn to restrict it to using the Ed25519 curve - making it
   non-polymorphic so that algorithm negotiation can succeed, but also
   effectively eliminating the possibility of using Ed448.  Other
   similar workarounds for polymorphic algorithm identifiers are used in
   practice.

   This specification creates fully-specified algorithm identifiers for
   registered polymorphic JOSE and COSE algorithms and their parameters,
   enabling applications to use only fully-specified algorithm
   identifiers.  It furthermore deprecates the practice of registering
   polymorphic algorithm identifiers.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Fully-Specified Digital Signature Algorithm Identifiers

   This section creates fully-specified digital signature algorithm
   identifiers for all registered polymorphic JOSE and COSE algorithms
   and their parameters.

2.1.  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

   [RFC9053] defines the current use of the Elliptic Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) by COSE.  The COSE algorithm
   registrations for ECDSA are polymorphic, since they do not specify
   the curve used.  For instance, ES256 is defined as "ECDSA w/ SHA-256"
   in Section 2.1 of [RFC9053].  (The corresponding JOSE registrations
   in [RFC7518] are full-specified.)

   The following fully-specified COSE ECDSA algorithms are defined:

      +========+==================+===================+=============+
      | Name   | COSE Value       | Description       | COSE        |

2.2.  Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)

   [RFC8037] defines the current use of the Edwards-Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) by JOSE and [RFC9053] defines its current
   use by COSE.  Both register polymorphic EdDSA algorithm identifiers.

   The following fully-specified JOSE and COSE EdDSA algorithms are
   defined:

    +=======+============+=============+================+=============+
    |Name   | COSE Value | Description | JOSE           | COSE        |

3.  Fully-Specified Encryption

   This section describes the construction of fully-specified encryption
   algorithm identifiers in the context of existing the JOSE and COSE
   encryption schemes JSON Web Encryption (JWE) as described in
   [RFC7516] and COSE Encrypt as described in [RFC9052].

3.1.  Fully-Specified Computations Using Multiple Algorithms

   Both JOSE and COSE have operations that take multiple algorithms as
   parameters.  Encrypted objects in JOSE [RFC7516] use two algorithm
   identifiers: the first in the alg (Algorithm) Header Parameter, which
   specifies how to determine the content encryption key, and the second
   in the enc (Encryption Algorithm) Header Parameter, which specifies
   the content encryption algorithm.  Likewise, encrypted COSE objects
   can use multiple algorithms for corresponding purposes.

   Each of these multiple algorithms must be independently fully
   specified.  The operations performed by each of them MUST NOT vary
   when used alongside other algorithms.  So for instance, for JOSE, alg
   values and enc values MUST each be fully specified, and their
   behaviors MUST NOT depend upon one another.

3.2.  Analysis of Modes of Encryption

   JOSE and COSE support several modes of encryption.  Although the
   terminology sometimes differs between JOSE and COSE, both support
   these encryption modes:

   *  Direct Encryption - A symmetric cryptographic operation.

   *  Key Establishment with Direct Encryption - An asymmetric
      cryptographic operation to derive a shared secret, key derivation
      and then a symmetric cryptographic operation.

   *  Two-Layer Encryption - A content encryption key is protected
      (multiple possible ways), then content encryption or decryption is
      performed using the protected content encryption key.

   Mode complexity creates the following risks:

   *  The combination of chosen algorithms might not be implemented by
      the receiver.

   *  The combination of chosen algorithms might not be aligned in terms
      of strength.

   *  Underspecified or implicit parameters could lead to exploitable
      faults in implementations, for example, cross-curve Elliptic Curve
      Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) between P-256 and P-384 or X25519.

   *  Alternative algorithms at a component layer, such as symmetric key
      encryption, might provide different security properties, for
      example, "A128GCM" vs. "A128CBC-HS256".

   While this specification provides a definition of what fully-
   specified encryption algorithm identifiers are for both JOSE and
   COSE, including examples, it does not deprecate any polymorphic
   algorithms, since complete replacements for them are not provided.
   It does register a small set of new fully-specified encryption
   algorithms, so that polymorphic encryption algorithms need not be
   used.

   The following sections describe what fully specified means for each
   mode.  They also register at least one fully-specified algorithm for
   each mode, when one was not already available.

3.2.1.  Direct Encryption

   Symmetric encryption algorithms generally satisfy the following
   interface:

   secret_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
   ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, secret_key)
   plaintext  = decrypt(ciphertext, secret_key)

   Depending on the algorithm, additional parameters such as Additional
   Authenticated Data (AAD) or Initialization Vector (IV) might be
   required.

   In the special case where the plaintext is a content encryption key,
   to be used with a subsequent symmetric encryption algorithm, such a
   symmetric encryption algorithm is referred to as a key wrapping
   algorithm and the secret_key is referred to as a key wrapping key.

   An example of a fully-specified symmetric encryption algorithm is
   "A128GCM" (AES GCM using 128-bit key).

   An example of a fully-specified key wrapping algorithm is "A128KW"
   (AES Key Wrap using 128-bit key).

   A symmetric encryption algorithm is fully specified when it satisfies
   the interface above, and depends only on the parameters to the
   encrypt and decrypt operations.

   Direct Encryption and Key Wrapping algorithms encode the primary
   symmetric key parameter (key length) in the algorithm identifier.
   Key Wrapping algorithms impose additional implicit constraints on AAD
   and IV.

   In JOSE and COSE, all currently registered Direct Encryption and Key
   Wrapping algorithms are fully specified.

   Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Direct Encryption:

   {
     "alg": "dir",
     "enc": "A128GCM",
     ...
   }

   Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Key Wrapping:

   {
     "alg": "A128KW",
     "enc": "A128GCM",
     ...
   }

3.2.2.  Key Establishment with Direct Encryption

   Key establishment with direct encryption algorithms generally satisfy
   the following interface:

   private_key, public_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
   ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, public_key)
   plaintext  = decrypt(ciphertext, private_key)

   Depending on the symmetric algorithm, additional parameters such as
   Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) or Initialization Vector (IV)
   might be required.

   Although JOSE and COSE encode this type of encryption differently,
   both rely on a symmetric key derived from an asymmetric key.  An
   algorithm called a key derivation function (KDF) is applied between
   key establishment and symmetric encryption.

   Key establishment algorithms often rely on an asymmetric
   cryptographic operation whereby a public and a private key are used
   to produce a shared secret, which can be combined with a KDF to
   produce a symmetric key.  The process of producing a shared secret is
   key type specific, and is different for elliptic curves, RSA, and
   lattice-based algorithms.

   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is used to produce a shared
   secret with elliptic curve-based keys as follows:

   private_key1, public_key1 = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
   private_key2, public_key2 = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
   shared_secret = derive_shared_secret(public_key1, private_key2)
   shared_secret = derive_shared_secret(public_key2, private_key1)

   An algorithm called a Key Encapsulation Mechanism, can be used to
   provide a common interface for deriving shared secrets, regardless of
   key type.

   Key encapsulation algorithms generally satisfy the following
   interface:

   private_key, public_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
   ciphertext, shared_secret = encapsulate(public_key)
   shared_secret = deencapsulate(ciphertext, private_key)

   When using Key Establishment with Direct Encryption, the ciphertext
   is not only the output of symmetric encryption, but also includes all
   parameters necessary for the recipient to decrypt the ciphertext.
   Encrypted content encryption keys are not produced by fully-specified
   Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithms.

   In JOSE, the KDF algorithm is "Concat KDF" and is an implicit
   parameter of the key establishment algorithm.  In JOSE and COSE, key
   establishment algorithms have historically been generic to a key type
   including all its mandatory parameters.  For example, "ECDH-ES"
   establishes a shared secret, and then through the use of a KDF, a
   content encryption key, for keys based on elliptic curves.  However,
   the mandatory parameters of the public_key and private_key need be
   the same in the context of the key type.

   For example, when using ECDH-ES with secp256r1 (P-256) to establish a
   shared secret, the ECDH algorithm is a function of an ephemeral and a
   static key, which need to be of the same key type, and having the
   same parameters, in this case, the curve parameter.

   To successfully encrypt to a recipient, a sender needs to possess the
   recipient's key (which contains the curve parameter) and know the
   recipients supported algorithms.

   In JOSE and COSE, key representations can support communicating the
   algorithm which a recipient supports for a given key.  It is
   considered a best practice to only support one algorithm during the
   lifetime of a key.

   Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Key Establishment with
   Direct Encryption:

   {
     "alg":"ECDH-ES",
     "enc":"A128GCM",
     ...
   }

   Despite containing both the key establishment algorithm (with an
   implicit KDF) and the symmetric encryption algorithm, the example
   above is not fully specified.

   To make a Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithm fully
   specified, all essential parameters need to be encoded in the
   algorithm identifier.  In the context of the example above, the
   missing explicit parameters are curve name and KDF name.  If the KDF
   requires additional parameters, they need to be present.

   To convey a fully-specified Key Establishment with Direct Encryption
   algorithm in JOSE, the "alg" value MUST be "dir", and the "enc" value
   MUST be fully specified, specifying all essential parameters for both
   key establishment and symmetric encryption.  For example: "ECDH-ES
   using P-256 and Concat-KDF with A128GCM" or "ECDH-ES using X25519 and
   Concat-KDF with A256GCM".

   To convey a fully-specified Key Establishment with Direct Encryption
   algorithm in COSE, the "alg" value MUST specify all essential
   parameters for both key establishment and symmetric encryption.  For
   example: "ECDH-ES using P-256 and HKDF SHA-256 with A128GCM" or
   "ECDH-ES using X25519 HKDF SHA-512 wit A256GCM".

   Fully-specified Key Establishment with Direct Encryption algorithms
   enable the sender and receiver to agree on all algorithms needed to
   encrypt and decrypt a message using a single algorithm identifier.

3.2.3.  Two-Layer Encryption

   This section describes Two-Layer Encryption in both JOSE and COSE.
   Each defines multiple ways that a content encryption key can be
   produced and protected, then later used to decrypt or encrypt
   content.

   This specification uses the term "Two-Layer Encryption" to refer to
   what JOSE describes as "Key Encryption" and "Key Agreement with Key
   Wrapping", and what COSE describes as "Key Transport" and "Key
   Agreement with Key Wrap".

   A distinguishing characteristic of Two-Layer Encryption schemes is
   that multiple recipients can perform decryptions, using a wide range
   of algorithms, and that encrypted content encryption keys are always
   present.

   In RSA-OAEP, the encrypted content encryption key is generated
   through an asymmetric cryptographic operation.

   When Key Wrapping without any key establishment is used, the content
   encryption key is encrypted using a symmetric cryptographic operation
   (key wrap).  How the content encryption key was generated is out of
   scope for this discussion.

   Key wrapping algorithms generally satisfy the following interface:

   key_encryption_key = \
   key_generation(algorithm_identifier)

   encrypted_content_encryption_key = \
   encrypt(content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)

   content_encryption_key  = \
   decrypt(encrypted_content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)

   When Key Establishment with Key Wrapping is used, the content
   encryption key is protected with Key Wrapping, where the Key
   Encryption Key is derived from an asymmetric cryptographic operation
   and a key derivation function.

   Key Establishment with Key Wrapping algorithms generally satisfy the
   following interface:

   private_key, public_key = key_generation(algorithm_identifier)
   # ignoring ephemeral/static vs. static/static, etc.

   key_encryption_key = \
   key_establishment(public_key, private_key)

   encrypted_content_encryption_key = \
   encrypt(content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)

   content_encryption_key = \
   decrypt(encrypted_content_encryption_key, key_encryption_key)

   The interface above is consistent with Key Establishment with Direct
   Encryption.  The process of deriving a shared secret and content
   encryption key is specific to the asymmetric key type used.  The
   difference is that instead of using the derived content encryption
   key directly, two-layer encryption always uses a key encryption key,
   and protects the content encryption key.

   Regardless of how a Two-Layer Encryption scheme protects the content
   encryption key, content encryption algorithms generally satisfy the
   following interface:

   content_encryption_key = \
   unwrap or establish and unwrap or key transport...

   ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, content_encryption_key)
   plaintext  = decrypt(ciphertext, content_encryption_key)

   Depending on the content encryption algorithm, additional parameters
   such as Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) and/or an Initialization
   Vector (IV) might be required.

   Although JOSE and COSE encode Two-Layer Encryptions differently, both
   rely on a protected content encryption key.  The content encryption
   key is protected using Key Wrapping directly, or through Key
   Establishment and then Key Wrapping, or Key Transport, or Key
   Encryption.

   When using Two-Layer Encryption, the ciphertext is not only the
   output of symmetric encryption, but also includes and/or is
   accompanied by all parameters necessary for the recipient to decrypt
   the ciphertext, including parameters for use with the key
   establishment algorithm, such as ephemeral or encapsulated keys, any
   required key derivation functions and their parameters and the key
   wrapping algorithm.  Encrypted content encryption keys are always
   present when Two-Layer Encryption algorithms are used.  Parameters
   accompanying the ciphertext can include an Initialization Vector
   (IV), an Authentication Tag, and Additional Authenticated Data (AAD).
   Two-Layer Encryption is often used for encrypting the same plaintext
   to multiple recipients, in contrast with other modes which can only
   be used to encrypt to a single recipient.

   Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Key Agreement with
   ECDH-ES:

   {
     "alg": "ECDH-ES",
     "enc": "A256GCM",
     ...
   }

   Example of a decoded JWE Protected Header, for Key Agreement using
   ECDH-ES and AES-KeyWrap with AES-GCM:

   {
     "alg": "ECDH-ES+A128KW",
     "enc": "A128GCM",
     ...
   }

   However, despite containing both the key establishment algorithm and
   a content encryption algorithm, the examples above are not fully
   specified.

   To make a Two-Layer Encryption algorithm fully specified, all
   security relevant details need to be encoded in the algorithm
   identifiers directly or be defined by the other algorithm.  In the
   context of the examples above, the missing explicit parameters are
   the curve name for the ephemeral key in both cases and for ECDH-ES,
   the keydatalen KDF parameter.

   To convey a fully-specified Two-Layer Encryption algorithm in JOSE,
   the "alg" value MUST explicitly specify all essential parameters for
   key establishment and key wrapping or have them be specified by the
   accompanying "enc" value.  For example: "ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and
   P-256" or "ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and P-256 and "A128KW" wrapping".
   The keydatalen KDF parameter value for ECDH-ES is determined from the
   "enc" value, as described in Section 4.6.2 of [RFC7518].

   To convey a fully-specified Two-Layer Encryption algorithm in COSE,
   the outer "alg" value MUST specify all essential parameters for key
   establishment and key wrapping.  For example: "ECDH-ES using P-256 w/
   HKDF" or "ECDH-ES using P-256 w/ HKDF and AES Key Wrap w/ 128-bit
   key".

   In COSE, preventing cross-mode attacks, such as those described in
   [RFC9459], can be accomplished in two ways: (1) Allow only
   authenticated content encryption algorithms. (2) Bind the the
   potentially unauthenticated content encryption algorithm to be used
   into the key protection algorithm so that different content
   encryption algorithms result in different content encryption keys.
   Which choice to use in which circumstances is beyond the scope of
   this specification.

   Fully-specified Two-Layer Encryption algorithms enable the sender and
   receiver to agree on all mandatory security parameters.  They also
   enable a protocol to specify an allow list of algorithm combinations
   that does not include polymorphic combinations, such as cross-curve
   key establishment, cross-mode symmetric encryption, or mismatched KDF
   size to symmetric key scenarios.

3.3.  Fully-Specified Encryption Algorithm Identifiers

3.3.1.  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)

   [RFC7518] defines the current use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) by JOSE.  Likewise, [RFC9053] defines the current use of
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) by COSE.  As described in
   Appendix A, both sets of registered ECDH algorithms are polymorphic.

   While Appendix A describes possible fully-specified ECDH algorithms
   that could be registered for JOSE and COSE, the working group decided
   to leave decisions about which fully-specified ECDH algorithms to
   register to future specifications, if needed.

4.3.  Updated Review Instructions for Designated Experts

4.3.1.  JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms

   IANA is directed to preserve the current reference to RFC 7518, and
   to add a reference to this section of this specification.

   The review instructions for the designated experts for the IANA "JSON
   Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry [IANA.JOSE] in
   Section 7.1 of [RFC7518] have been updated to include an additional
   review criterion:

   *  Only fully-specified algorithm identifiers may be registered.
      Polymorphic algorithm identifiers must not be registered.

4.3.2.  COSE Algorithms

   IANA is directed to preserve the current references to RFC 9053 and
   RFC 9054, and to add a reference to this section of this
   specification.

   The review instructions for the designated experts for the IANA "COSE
   Algorithms" registry [IANA.COSE] in Section 10.4 of [RFC9053] have
   been updated to include an additional review criterion:

   *  Only fully-specified algorithm identifiers may be registered.
      Polymorphic algorithm identifiers must not be registered.

4.4.  Defining Deprecated and Prohibited

   The terms "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" as used by JOSE and COSE
   registrations are currently undefined.  Furthermore, while in
   [RFC7518] JOSE specifies that both "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" can
   be used, in [RFC8152] COSE specifies the use of "Deprecated" but not
   "Prohibited".  (Note that [RFC9053] did not carry the definitions of
   the "Recommended" registry columns forward, so [RFC8152] remains
   definitive in this regard.)  This section defines these terms for use
   by both JOSE and COSE IANA registrations in a consistent manner,
   eliminating this potentially confusing inconsistency.

   For purposes of use in the "JOSE Implementation Requirements" columns
   in the IANA JOSE registries [IANA.JOSE] and in the "Recommended"
   columns in the IANA COSE registries [IANA.COSE], these terms are
   defined as follows:

   Deprecated
      There is a preferred mechanism to achieve similar functionality to
      that referenced by the identifier; this replacement functionality
      SHOULD be utilized in new deployments in preference to the
      deprecated identifier.

   Prohibited
      The identifier and the functionality that it references MUST NOT
      be used.  (Identifiers MAY be designated as "Prohibited" due to
      security flaws, for instance.)

   Note that the terms "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" have been used with
   a multiplicity of different meanings in various specifications,
   sometimes without actually being defined in those specifications.
   For instance, the term "Deprecated" is used in the title of
   [RFC8996], but the actual specification text uses the terminology
   "MUST NOT be used".

   The definitions above were chosen because they are consistent with
   all existing registrations in both JOSE and COSE; none will need to
   change.  Furthermore, they are consistent with their existing usage
   in JOSE.  The only net change is to enable a clear distinction
   between "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" in future COSE registrations.

5.  Key Representations

   The key representations for the new fully-specified algorithms
   defined by this specification are the same as those for the
   polymorphic algorithms that they replace, other than the alg value,
   if included.  For instance, the representation for a key used with
   the Ed25519 algorithm is the same as that specified in [RFC8037],
   except that the alg value would be Ed25519 rather than EdDSA, if
   included.

6.  Notes on Algorithms Not Updated

   The working group has discussed some existing algorithms that are not
   updated by this specification.  This section discusses why they have
   not been updated.

6.1.  RSA Signing Algorithms

   The working group has discussed whether the RS256, RS384, and RS512
   algorithms should be considered fully-specified or not, because they
   can operate on keys of different sizes.  For instance, they can use
   both 2048- and 4096-bit keys.  The same is true of the PS*
   algorithms.

   This is not a problem in practice, because RSA libraries accommodate
   keys of different sizes without having to use different code.
   Therefore, for example, there are not known cases in the wild where
   it would be useful to have different algorithm identifiers for
   RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-256 and 2048-bit keys versus 4096-bit keys
   or 8192-bit keys.  Therefore, the RSA signature algorithms are not
   replaced by this specification.

   That said, should it be useful at some point to have RSA algorithm
   identifiers that are specific to the key size, a future specification
   could always register them.

6.2.  ECDH Key Agreement Algorithms

   As discussed in Section 3.3.1 and Appendix A, the working group
   decided not to update the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   algorithms at this time, but to describe how to potentially do so in
   the future, if needed.

7.  Security Considerations

   Using fully-specified algorithm identifiers reduces the attack
   surface relative to using polymorphic algorithm identifiers, since it
   reduces the opportunity for attackers to choose insecure or
   unexpected combinations of algorithms.

   The security considerations for ECDSA in [RFC7518], for EdDSA in
   [RFC8037], and for ECDSA and EdDSA in [RFC9053] apply.

Appendix A.  Inventory of Polymorphic ECDH Algorithms

   The working group assembled the following inventory of registered
   polymorphic Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) JOSE and COSE
   algorithms with the goal of understanding what registering fully-
   specified ECDH algorithms to replace them would entail.  While there
   was not an appetite in the working group to register these
   replacement algorithms at this time, this inventory documents how to
   do so, should others wish to register some or all of the replacements
   in the future.

A.1.  Polymorphic ECDH JOSE Algorithms

   These registered JOSE algorithms are polymorphic, because they do not
   include the curve name in the algorithm to be used with the ephemeral
   key:

    +================+================================================+
    | Name           | Description                                    |

   Descriptions of fully-specified JOSE versions of these algorithms
   using combinations discussed by the working group that could be
   registered by future specifications are:

A.2.  Polymorphic ECDH COSE Algorithms

   These registered COSE algorithms are likewise polymorphic, because
   they do not include the curve name in the algorithm to be used with
   the ephemeral key or the static key:

     +====================+==========================================+
     | Name               | Description                              |

Appendix B.  Document History

   [[ to be removed by the RFC Editor before publication as an RFC ]]

   -05

   *  Applied IANA early review comments.

   -04

   *  Removed ECDH registrations and proposed fully-specified ECDH
      algorithm identifiers, per feedback at IETF 120.

   *  Tightened descriptive text for fully-specified encryption
      algorithms.

   *  Applied John Mattsson's suggestion for the RSA section title.

   -03

   *  Acknowledged contributions made during Working Group Last Call.

   *  Addressed security considerations feedback from WGLC.

   *  Made COSE Recommended status for Ed25519 and Ed448 "yes".

   *  Registered COSE algorithms for using Brainpool curves with ECDSA.

   *  Removed text on KEMs, since currently registered algorithms don't
      use them.

   *  Enabled use of fully-specified ECDH algorithms.

   *  Defined the terms "Deprecated" and "Prohibited" for both JOSE and
      COSE registrations.

   -02

   *  Expanded references for KEMs.

   *  Added example of a fully-specified KEM.

   -01

   *  Included additional instructions for IANA.

   *  Added text on KEMs and Encapsulated keys.

   *  Added the section Fully-Specified Computations Using Multiple
      Algorithms.

   -00

   *  Created initial working group version based on draft-jones-jose-
      fully-specified-algorithms-02.
